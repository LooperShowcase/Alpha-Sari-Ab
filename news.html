    <h5>Liverpool in season 22/23</h5>
    <p>
      The 2022-23 season was Liverpool's 131st season of football since they
      were established.<br />
      The Reds began their campaign with victory in the Community Shield, for
      the first time since 2006.<br />
      The rest of the season did not bring the same success however, as the Reds
      finished 5th and failed to win<br />
      another trophy, failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first
      time since the 2015-16 season.<br>
      <br>Liverpool kicked off the season with a 3–1 victory over reigning Premier League champions Manchester City
       in the FA Community Shield for their 16th Community Shield and 68th official trophy, the latter being an
        English record. Furthermore, that piece of silverware completed the set for Jürgen Klopp, as he had won
         all available first-tier trophies with Liverpool.

<p>After narrowly missing out on a possible quadruple the previous season, the 2022–23 campaign was a bitter disappointment for
   Liverpool. Inconsistent form in the Premier League ruled them out of the title race, whilst the Reds were knocked out of both
    cups in the fourth round. Liverpool's Champions League campaign also ended in disappointment and another defeat to Real Madrid,
     with a poor 2–5 loss at Anfield followed up with a 1–0 defeat at the Bernabéu.
