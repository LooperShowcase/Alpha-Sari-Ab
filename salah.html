    Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly (Arabic: محمد صلاح حامد محروس غالي, Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: 
     born 15 June 1992), known as Mohamed Salah or Mo Salah, is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a right winger or
     forward for Premier League club Liverpool and captains the Egypt national team. Widely regarded as one of the best players of his
      generation and one of the greatest African players of all time, he is known for his clinical finishing, dribbling and speed.
      Salah started his senior career in 2010 playing for Al Mokawloon, departing in 2012 to join Basel, where he won two Swiss Super
       League titles. In 2014, Salah joined Chelsea for a reported fee of £11 million, but limited gametime led to successive loans to
        Fiorentina and Roma, who later signed him permanently for €15 million. In the 2016–17 season, Salah was a key figure in Roma's
         unsuccessful title bid, reaching double figures in both goals and assists.
